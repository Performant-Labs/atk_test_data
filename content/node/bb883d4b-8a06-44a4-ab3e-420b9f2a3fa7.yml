      value: "<p>I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. This concept of “wuv” confuses and infuriates us! On margin! Zoidey wanna buy on margin! Congratulations! I assume Amy is the father. Why always the fighting? What a clever impersonation of a stupid poor person! How much is that place mat actually worth, Brannigan?</p><p>But if rich people think it’s good, I’ll buy it. One art, please! I got your distress call and came here as soon as I wanted to. Finally, a uniform I'd be happy to be caught dead in. And, boy, does it wick away moisture. Gallons and gallons of it. I don’t have emotions &amp;amp; sometimes that makes me very sad.</p><p>I saw a frilly cake in here you’d remember all your life. I know I will. Every night it haunts me with its frosted beauty. Order the cake, dammit! Fry, it's been years since medical school, so remind me... Disemboweling your species: fatal or non-fatal? My story is a lot like yours, only more interesting ‘cause it involves robots.</p><p>Dammit Kif, where’s the little umbrella? That’s what makes it a scotch on the rocks! What a clever impersonation of a stupid poor person! How much is that place mat actually worth, Brannigan? Ah, there’s nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning! There's nothing wrong with murder. Just as long as you let Bender wet his beak.</p><p>And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest. This concept of “wuv” confuses and infuriates us! A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. Fry, it's been years since medical school, so remind me... Disemboweling your species: fatal or non-fatal? I ate garbage yesterday, and it didn’t cost me 300 dollars!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
